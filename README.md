# Cloud Computing Workshop

## Introduction

Welcome! In this workshop, we'll be covering how you can take advantage of cloud computing and hosting with AWS.

**Note:** By creating an AWS account, *you'll provide AWS with your credit card information*. All of the workshop sections below can easily be completed while staying on the "free tier" of AWS (they won't charge you for a variety of services). Make sure to read *all* directions, and **always spin down your machines and resources when you are done with them. HackBU is not responsible for any charges you incur on your AWS account.**
